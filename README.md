# meet-the-team

Tools and techniques used in this project:
1. SCSS Preprocessor;
2. SCSS variables to store values such as colors for reuse and consistency throughout a project;
3. SCSS nesting to organize styles within styles, making it easier to see the relationships between different styles and reducing the amount of repetitive code;
4. SCSS loop `@each` in order not to repeat a set of styles multiple times;
5. SCSS partials to breake up a large SCSS file into smaller, more manageable files that can be imported into a main SCSS file for processing;
6. CSS animation and keyframes;
